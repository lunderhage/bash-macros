# Lunderhage's Bash Macros

These are my macros I tend to want on different machines both at work and privately.

Please feel free to use, improve and contribute!

## Installation

1. Clone this repo at a location of your choice.
2. Run ```install.sh``` to install the macros.
3. Open a new terminal OR ```source ~/.bash_aliases```

*Note: Moving this repo will cause the macros to not work!*
